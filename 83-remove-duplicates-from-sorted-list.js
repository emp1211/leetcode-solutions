Explanation: This is similar to problem "26. Remove Duplicates
from a Sorted Array" and may be helpful to start with that
challenge firstâ€”but the idea is the same: we need to iterate over
the list only once because it is sorted. Starting with the head node
as the current node, we compare the current node's value property 
(curr.val) with the next node's value property (curr.next.val), and 
if we have a match we simply point the current node's next property to
the node that is one beyond curr.next. This leaves the 
duplicate node as an orphan node and it is effectively 'removed' from
our sorted list. When we find and orphan a duplicate, we do NOT want to 
move our current node to the next node. First, we compare the current 
node againto the new next node. Only when the values are different,
 do we move our current node to the next node in the list. 
 When we return the head node, now all duplicates have been
 removed (orphaned) and we are left with a sorted linked list 
 and no duplicate nodes.
